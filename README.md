# Sorting-Algorithm-Analysis-Project
A project to compare and analyze the efficiencies of BubbleSort, SelectionSort, and QuickSort.

After generating a random, unsorted student body, a program would sort the body using BubbleSort, SelectionSort, and QuickSort. Average runtimes were collected in the program and used later on for analysis.

At the end of the project using the results, one can clearly see that quicksort is by far a lot more efficient than its two counterparts.
